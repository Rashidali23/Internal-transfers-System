---

## üîß Requirements

- Go 1.20+
- PostgreSQL (running locally or in Docker)

## üîß Requirements
 Before running the application, you need to configure your PostgreSQL connection details.

 Update your conf.env file with correct PostgreSQL credentials:
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_USER=postgres
    DB_PASSWORD=user
    DB_NAME=transfers
    DB_MASTER_NAME=postgres
    DB_SSLMODE=disable

DB_HOST: Hostname or IP where your PostgreSQL is running

DB_PORT: Port number (default is 5432)

DB_USER: PostgreSQL username

DB_PASSWORD: PostgreSQL password

DB_NAME: The database your app will use (e.g., transfers) 

DB_MASTER_NAME: The default database used to create DB_NAME if it doesn't exist (usually postgres)

DB_SSLMODE: Set to disable for local setups

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure these values match your PostgreSQL setup, otherwise the app won't connect correctly.
